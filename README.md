CFPAYMENT
=========

ColdFusion payment processing library makes plumbing e-commerce apps easy.  

Rather than roll your own gateway with error, currency and money handling, leverage one of our production-tested gateways or extend our base gateway and write only the code necessary to create requests and parse responses for your gateway. Eliminates writing boilerplate code and handling esoteric CFHTTP errors that only seem to happen in production.

Tens of millions of dollars have been processed successfully.  Inspired by Ruby's ActiveMerchant.
